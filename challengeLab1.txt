
A file named /etc/services has been located that contains the pertinent information; however it is not organized to easily determine all of the services.

Objectives

Extract all the service names from the file.
Sort the names alphabetically removing any duplicates.
Remove any blank lines or lines that do not begin with a letter of the alphabet.
Capture the final output to a file named uniqueservices.txt.
Count the lines in the file using a conditional command that is only executed if the previous combined commands are successful.

cut -d " " -f 1 /etc/services|cut -f 1|sort -u|grep "^[a-zA-z]" > uniqueservices.txt && wc -l uniqueservices.txt
